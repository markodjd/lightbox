# lightbox
Vanilla JavaScript and CSS lightbox


To implement this lightbox on your web page, do the following:

1. Add lightbox.js file in your project folder and link it in your HTML file
2. Add lightbox.css file the same way as lightbox.js and link it in your HTML file
3. Copy two SVG images from folder "images" in your project folder
4. Go to lightbox.js and change paths to those two images in rows 37 and 44 to yourpath/to/images
3. Create an empty div wherever you want with class "images"
4. Place how many images you want in that div (dont't put anything else besides images)

You can style the div however you want and place as many images inside it as you want

Thank you :)
